# hello-world
First github goodness! 


So I've just completed a codeacademy course in Python and now I find out that freecodecamp exists and puts me in the shoes of a trainee developer heping non-profit organisations around the world! I'm super duced to get working on making the web a brighter better place by learning and helping at the same time! I can't wait to get stuck in!
